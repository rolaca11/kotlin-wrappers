/**
     * {@link createServer} sets the default value of the `honorCipherOrder` option
     * to `true`, other APIs that create secure contexts leave it unset.
     *
     * {@link createServer} uses a 128 bit truncated SHA1 hash value generated
     * from `process.argv` as the default value of the `sessionIdContext` option, other
     * APIs that create secure contexts have no default value.
     *
     * The `tls.createSecureContext()` method creates a `SecureContext` object. It is
     * usable as an argument to several `tls` APIs, such as {@link createServer} and `server.addContext()`, but has no public methods.
     *
     * A key is _required_ for ciphers that use certificates. Either `key` or`pfx` can be used to provide it.
     *
     * If the `ca` option is not given, then Node.js will default to using [Mozilla's publicly trusted list of
     * CAs](https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/raw-file/tip/security/nss/lib/ckfw/builtins/certdata.txt).
